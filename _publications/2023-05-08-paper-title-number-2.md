excerpt: 'In our research, we examined how externally applied electric fields affect the entropy of bulk water through classical TIP4P/2005 and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. My role involved conducting the classical molecular dynamics simulations using the TIP4P/2005 model and analyzing the results. We found that while strong electric fields can align water molecules, they only cause slight reductions in entropy, indicating that electrofreezing is improbable in bulk water at room temperature. Additionally, we developed a new analytical method, 3D-2PT, which allows for the spatial resolution of local entropy and number density of water in an electric field, offering comprehensive insights into the entropic and structural alterations at the atomic level.'
