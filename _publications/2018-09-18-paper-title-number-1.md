excerpt: 'In this study, we synthesized two novel isostructural twin hybrids, Comp1: [H(C10H10N2)Cu2][PMo12O40] and Comp2: [H(C10H10N2)Cu2][PW12O40], using Keggin ions, Cu(I) cations, and 4,4′-bipyridine. My role involved the hydrothermal synthesis of both compounds, successful isolation of pure, homogeneous crystals, and their application as catalysts in the oxidation of various organic compounds like ethylbenzene, cyclohexanol, and cyclooctene. Both compounds formed crystals in the monoclinic P21/c space group with closely matching lattice parameters and crystal structures. Despite their structural similarity, Comp2 exhibited superior catalytic performance, particularly in the oxidation of ethylbenzene and cyclooctene, as well as in the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue. Furthermore, studies on their electrochemical pseudocapacitance suggest potential applications of these polyoxometalate-based metal-organic frameworks (POMOFs) in charge storage and conducting devices, contingent upon enhancements in their electrochemical stability.'
