excerpt: "Here we investigated how different alterations to force fields influence the conformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins in simulations. Our findings indicate that various approaches to adjusting intra-protein and protein-water interactions distinctly affect protein solvation, especially concerning the hydration of polar and nonpolar functional groups. These variations are not completely reflected by global metrics such as the radius of gyration, yet they are essential for understanding the protein's propensity to aggregate or form phase-separated droplets."
