excerpt: "Here we investigated how different alterations to force fields influence the conformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins in simulations. Our findings indicate that various approaches to adjusting intra-protein and protein-water interactions distinctly affect protein solvation, especially concerning the hydration of polar and nonpolar functional groups. These variations are not completely reflected by global metrics such as the radius of gyration, yet they are essential for understanding the protein's propensity to aggregate or form phase-separated droplets.
Here we explored the dielectric responses of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) in solutions were through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and theoretical frameworks. My contribution here was conducting all the simulations to produce the necessary trajectories. We observed a significant increase in the linear dielectric function of IDPs compared to the solvent, attributed to their large dipole moments. IDPs exhibit a pronounced nonlinear dielectric effect (NDE) that surpasses that of standard electrolytes, providing insights into their conformational and rotational dynamics. The IDPs' conformational flexibility aligns the dipole moment statistics with gamma/log-normal distributions, enhancing the NDE. This effect, influenced by the dipole moment's intrinsic non-Gaussian parameter, interacts with protein osmotic compressibility to affect the nonlinear dielectric susceptibility, particularly under conditions of reduced electrolyte screening.
